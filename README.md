Abstract: _The pair creation from the Breit–Wheeler process is one of the basic processes in the universe. Laser induced intense γ-ray sources will allow a direct observation of this process in the laboratory for the first time. In this paper we demonstrate the effect of pair beaming in the collision of two photon beams which may facilitate the experimental observation of the Breit–Wheeler process._
